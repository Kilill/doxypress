The class library includes all the functionality needed to build advanced GUI applications.

  \li Complete set of customizable UI controls/widgets
  \li 3D graphics support with OpenGL
  \li Powerful multi-threading features
  \li 2D graphics canvas capable of handling millions of items
  \li Integrated Phonon multimedia framework
  \li WebKit integration
  \li Networking, XML, and database functionality
  \li ECMA standard scripting engine


<h3>Integrated Development Tools</h3>

Integrated development tools are available for the X11 platform.

  \li Qt Designer provides a drag and drop visual GUI builder
  \li Qt Linguist provides internationalization and translation features


<h3>Cross-Platform Development using Qt Creator</h3>

Qt Creator is a complete Cross-platform IDE included in the Qt SDK. The IDE allows
programmers to create, build, debug and run applications across all supported platforms.


<h3>GTK Support</h3>

The binary CopperSpice libraries have GTK support turned off.

If you want support for GTK you must build the CopperSpice libraries from source
on a machine that has GTK development libraries installed. When GTK is detected at
compile time, support will nr added to CsGui. At run time of an application linked with
this version of CsGui, GTK must be present on the target system.
