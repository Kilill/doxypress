/*!
\class Lemongrass
\brief Test class

Lemongrass is a test class to ensure two classes in one file can be documented. The following text to addHoliday() 
and monthName() test auto linking methods. 

These two auto link: monthName(int value),  monthName(int)

This does not link, which is correct: monthName

Does the link from the QSSsl namespace work correct?   QSsl::someFunction()
