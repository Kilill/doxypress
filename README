DoxyPress is a modern C++ application for generating documentation from annotated sources.

The lex parser for handling C++ is being phased out and libClang 
will be used for all parsing and comment documentation. This will enable DoxyPress
to parse future versions of C++ as they become available.

DoxyPress and DoxyPressApp were from Doxygen and DoxyWizard.

Major enhancements include:

 * Removed all Qt 2 classes and containers
 * Redesigned to leverage value based containers instead of pointer based containers
 * Project file format enhanced to use a JSON format for maintainability and improved functionality
 * Enhanced the layout file to include several new sections
 * Improved and corrected html output
 * Added a new parser for makefiles
 * New command line option to convert older project files to DoxyPress format
 * DoxyPress links with the CopperSpice libraries
 * Code reformatted and modified to use C++11 functionality, features, and syntax 
 * Updated to leverage variadic templates and shared pointers
